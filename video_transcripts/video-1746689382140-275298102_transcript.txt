Hi guys, in this video we're gonna start building our new web app that's called RoboFriends. In this RoboFriends you can see there are some cards in which there are robots and with their names and email and also you can see that whenever we type any name it will filter out the name of that robot like just clean so we're gonna build this so before building it we're gonna use the tool and that Facebook provides so that developer can easily write only the react code and do not do and not to worry about what going on under the hood so that's called react react app what it do that it will just we're gonna write any react code and it will convert that react code into the older JavaScript code so that our browser can answer that react code so yeah so we're gonna install through npx create react app and the name of the app in here you can see the npx is not a typo it just a package runner tool which comes after the version of 5.2 of npm I have already installed or I have already used the command I have used I have created a new folder react course and in there I have go to the react course folder by using CD and I have used npx to create react app and the name of the app that you want and it will install it will take some time I have already installed it and then I have gone to the CD RoboFriends the app folder and I have opened the in our visual studio core and you can see in here that this is the visual studio core RoboFriends app you can see in here that this is the name yeah RoboFriends and we're gonna see what the package is on what are the scripts on what are the dependencies are there first two main are react and react hyphen DOM react what is used for like base which is used for creating a UI or creating view and there is one react hyphen DOM this is what we use when we are gonna use for web app there is one other another like other DOM's other yeah other DOM like react native which is used for apps there is other react 360 that is for VR apps so yeah and in here there is one react scripts and this is the one important because this through this that we are seeing all the or using the create react app yeah in this it will convert the code that we are gonna write in source folder and it will convert that script into some other code or other codes and it will zone into the browser so we don't have to worry about any paper or web back in here there are some scripts you can see what are the scripts are here there is one and start start is what will we do first I already use the npm start so you just have to write like this if you are new just write npm start just enter it and you can see what is going on and this is what will be shown into your browser or into your command prompt and when you open into your browser you can see this is what it looks like and yeah and there is one build build is what we used for VR and this script when we are gonna use this our project into production like anyone can see our project so that's when we are gonna build use our build script this test testing and we're gonna use this one when we're gonna test some cases yeah and there is one exact exact we're gonna use when like we're gonna configure our some bevel config yeah bevel and web pack so not to worry about this act if we don't have to use this act here so now we are gonna see in our app.js in app.js you can say that we have first imported the react from react because this is what we do when we are gonna show any any view so this you can see in here this div tag and all the things that are written here this is what we see in our project in our local history 2001 this is what looks like and in here you can see that how can we import some CSS we can import through dots less app dot CSS or import some SVG file or image file this is how can we do we will see how can we how can we write how it is written in code and here this you can say this is a functional component called app this is functional component app you can convert this into a class component app we will see how can we do this and there's one more features about of react app create react app like whenever we're like we're gonna change something like hello and if we save it we don't have to like refresh the browser or anything we can see that it will be reflected back to the our browser instant or it will say take one or two seconds if the project is big so so this is how this is important but there's one thing how it is linked to the like we cannot see any index or the HTML file well this is what necessary in here so you can see there is one app and there is one here you can see index or JS let's see what it is and index or JS yeah you can see in here in the extra JS in here you can see the app and the same app that we have used in here so there this is the one that have imported that that is the describing to this app.js file in here you can see that we are gonna use react term dot ranger it will like react on will be rendering this app component and in the all app component is linked to the document dot get element by ID root so there is one root ID somewhere so where it is so we're gonna just log into our public folder in public folder is when index dot HTML and we open it index dot HTML you can see oh there is one index dot HTML file in here in here you can see yeah there is one do ID equal to root so this is how it is linked you can see this is how this link to this index dot JS if you are not like I'm just babbling about something you can see in here our inspector in here you can see d wide equal to root and in here there is deep glass equal to app you can see that the same thing are written there now a code and when we open like components you can see there is one component app but there is nothing in here because yeah because this is one component that was written so yeah so this can be say that we have like instilled something about like from the top what is what it is going on how these all are linking how these all are linked and now we're gonna just build our this simple or sample react project into this robo friends app yeah thank you
