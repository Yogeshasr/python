Welcome to the easy time application. Your one stop to effortless time tracking and management. This tutorial is to show you how to create a new time sheet as an employee. First up, you will be created by the login page where you will have to enter the username given to you by the company and the password being your system password. Let me quickly fill in the details. Next, click on login. This takes you to the onboarding screen where you will be able to view all the time sheets that have been submitted so far. In order to create a new time sheet, we click on the new time sheet button in the top right corner. This takes you to the new time sheet page where it shows who the time sheet is being prepared for. First, we select the time sheet period for which we are trying to fill the time sheet. This activates the fields below. Next, we click on new line. Now we will be able to enter the project, the activity, the hours that we have logged in so far and our supervisor. Let me quickly fill in the details. Once we have entered all the details of that particular row, we click on the save button to save the row. We get a confirmation message saying that the row has been saved successfully. Next, we click on submit. A pop-up appears which says review time sheet that is, are we filling the time sheet for ourselves or for someone else? We select self and then click on submit. Our time sheet has been successfully submitted. I hope this was useful. Thank you.
