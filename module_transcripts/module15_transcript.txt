Hi guys, in this video we are going to start building our COVID-19 stats web app. In here you can see all the countries are given which are affected by COVID-19 and you can see for each country you have cases like active cases and confirm cases and recovered and deaths. Now for each country there are bunch of countries are in here so I have created one search box in where you can just type in your country name and just know what's the state or what's the cases of COVID-19 in their countries. Now in our back to code I have created one app called React app COVID-19 Hyphen Cases in which we are gonna do our coding. Now if you don't know how I have created this React app you can just go to the previous video and just see how I have created this new app. Now in here first of all I'm going to convert this functional component app into a class component such that we can use more functions or methods that are given in a class. So simply we're gonna just type in class app and that's gonna extend with react.com. where benefits are many important sub methods are there. So first method is render method in where we can just return it and what we're gonna return we're gonna return the same JSX syntax and the syntax the JSX syntax is the same. This is the JSX syntax that is called Javascript template extension template. Now in here what you can see that we're gonna learn one more concept called state concept so that we can achieve declarative concept. Now for this we're gonna just use constructor make each class has default constructor in here or method. Now we can use super methods such that we can use attributes of React app component in our app component. Now in here one thing called is this start state. Now this is one important object in here. So basically this start state is a Javascript object which we're gonna inject into our render method. When the method means we're gonna inject in this JSX syntax. So first of all JSX is a estimate look like structure which is written inside render method but it is not a JS HTML because you can see that in an image tag you cannot see one slash at the end in actual HTML syntax. So it is different from actual HTML syntax. Now in this start state first we're gonna just use some name like name is some Francisco as I have said that the start state is a Javascript object which we're gonna inject in our render method. Now for how can we do this? Now in here what we can do we can just type in here using curly braces and in curly braces you can use this dot state dot name. Now just you can see if you just type in here and go to your browser you can see the Francisco is written in here. So what's what you can see in here that there is one thing called curly braces. Now curly braces is what makes it more dynamic because curly braces inside the curly braces it is a expression it is a Javascript expression and what is a logo in here it is a variable but it's also a Javascript expression. So you can know from here that we have used the curly braces for injecting some dynamically but it's not dynamically we are just assigning some variables and using name as a variable in here which we're gonna get from this start state dot name. Like we haven't started building our app but I'm going to just give some knowledge about what is happening inside this syntax. In here you can see the class name which is simply like CSS which we're gonna use with class but in here we add gives class name that's because class is basically a keyword for Javascript and so React has given class name for using class in our JSX. Now in here you can see that each attribute is a JSX attribute not a HTML attribute so you can see that this is completely different with the HTML. Now one more thing you can do in here like you can see that it is given this or state dot name. Now if I want to change the name of this dot state dot name to something called just give Michael now how can we do that? So for doing plus four we're gonna create some event as you know for changing anything you want some event so what we're gonna do we're gonna just create a one button and simply say the name change name. Now what's first we can see that if we got the button or not yeah we got the button. Now in here we're just what we're gonna do when we click on button it's gonna change the name in here so it is gonna use by on click and on click is a function so it will it is a on a so I'm firing an anonymous function in here and now I'm going to change the name of this dot state so we can do this like yeah this dot state dot name is equal to Michael yeah yeah you can use it into your own laptop but I assure that this is wrong you can see this is wrong so how can we do this for doing this we are the we are given method called this dot set state in here this gives I have create I have open and close curly braces in here you're gonna just give the properties that you want to change so in here I have only one property name and I'm going to change into Michael now it's done so what I have done this is on click method but it's not the actual HTML on click method you can see that in actual on click method is written like this on click but in here in react you have camel cases on click many methods are there in react which is in camel cases and on click is a event which we're gonna call with an anonymous function and we're gonna use this dot set state and we are changing the name to Michael now if we look into our browser and just click on change name you can see that we got Michael so there are maybe three things we have learned in this video first of all how can we convert our function component into a class component second of second of all what is a state so we study the JavaScript object which we are gonna inject into our JSX in text now what's a JSX JSX is a HTML look like structure but it is written inside JavaScript and there is one curly braces so inside the curly braces what we're gonna write we're gonna write JavaScript expression so it is an expression now I have also used one event call and when we are gonna use button and when we're gonna click on it it's gonna change the state of name to Michael so thank you in this video we have learned these things in the next video we're gonna definitely start building our app so thanks

Hi guys, in this video we are going to build our own components. As you can see, there are the components in here. This is a country component you can see. And these are all bunch of country components. And it is inside one wrapper component called Contrarilyist component. We are going to see how it's built. So for now, back to code. In here, you can see that one thing more I have to do. That whenever you go to your browser and check in your component, ReactOlopertools, you can see that for each country you haven't got the country code. Because in the next video you can see that it is important to get the country code. So how can we get the country code? As you can know that for each country, in the country app, in the country, you have the ISO 2. This is what a country code means. So I'm going to get the country code from this. So how can we do that? As you can know, there is one concept or there is one concept. In the JavaScript called SpreadingOperator. If you know that's fine, if you don't know, just see. First of all, this is an object. And we have wrapped around curly braces because it's an object. If it's an array, we have to use the square bracket, but it's an object. Now you have to give three dots such that it will spread out all the content inside the Java. In the object, now, in here you have to give what properties you have to change. So I have to change the country code in here. So just type in country code and just set the value in here. And we can use using country.isotu. That's it. That's how you can set the value. Now if you just save it and go to your browser, it will text on there. In here, just go to stats and just select the one. Yeah. In here, you can see that we got the country code. Yeah, definitely. Perfectly. Now we're going to create one components. I have already created one folder called components inside the source folder. Because we're going to learn in here how we're going to build our own component just as app.js has been built. And using to our project. So in components folder, we're going to again create a new folder. So it's that we have like it's it is a systematic way to create a developer's can see what you have done and also build on upon it. So you have to like write a clean code and and use a like easy to debug. So I have building like a clean code and yeah, now I'm going to create a new file and it's name a control list and just say control is torjs not to build not to give big name. Now just give import react from react such that we can view. That's why we have are going to use react. And in here I'm going to use functional component in here not to build a class component. Now in here. I'm going to return something but what we're going to return we're going to see next. And for now just to kind of export it such that we can import it in the country in the app.js. So in here you have to like import it. So just import it import what import control list import list from where dots less components less control list less control list. Yeah. And you don't have to give dot JS extension because it knows the editor knows what you are doing. Now I'm just going to remove it or just copy it. And that's what we are going to write into our. Contrally storjs in here I'm going to use countries. Or just use stats. Yeah stats is better. And just select what we're going to give it to it. This or a status. That's it. Now we just save it. And you can see this is an attribute and we are just assigning the all the data to a variable call stats. Now how can we get data that we have assigned to this country list component or this country list component. So in here what we get is props. This is a props. There are two things that is stat and props. And I'm going to differentiate between tools in later videos for now just look into it. And this props is just like a state. It's a JavaScript object. Now in here what we get we get these things. Now we don't have to write this because it's not a class. So we have to remove it. And in the place of stats we're going to use props in here. And we're just going to write this one. Yeah. Yeah that's it. Yeah if just looking to your project you can see we got the names. Yeah that's why you get this good. Now what we're going to do like you can see that it's good but this is a country list. Oh there there's name naming problem. Yeah just changing to country list in here because after this we're going to build country component not a country list component in here. Yeah that's good. Yeah that's good. Yeah that's fine. Now in here this is a listing of countries you can say but we're going to build each component has a country a country component in where we have amazed the name of the country and the description of the Corona cases. So for that purpose we have to build one more folder called country. And that's what the developer do man. This react developer you have to know what how much you have to divide one company. That's what red developer do and that's what I'm doing in here. So I'm going to just use country component country.js. In here I'm going to use import react from react. Yeah. And use the cost country and we are going to use props in here. Yes you have to know because this is how we can get the data from other component. Now next what it is. Now next we're going to just remove it but we don't need this right now. What we need is import what import import country import country from where from dot dot slash country slash country that's what we need. I'll just check in yeah okay okay yeah. In here what we're going to give we're going to give country. And in country we're going to give the state stats you can give your stats is what we're going to give. And what we're going to give props country yeah just give it the country yeah. This is what we're going to give. That's it yeah. Oh just one thing we have to export it also so just you export default country. And in here just for check for right now we're going to just give the props props dot states dot country. I'll just save it and save this also and just go to your project and you can see that we got the same thing well done perfect. Now in the console you can see there is one warning you can see and it's always warning whenever you're going to use map method inside the JSX. So here you can see each child in a list should have a unique key prop what this means now in here this country you can see this is a country list. But there are a bunch of countries are in here so how can react distinguished between each country because this have similar component that's how that's the key comes into the picture from the key the react knows what or which component have to change or re render so that other components don't have to re render. So whenever the chance come whenever we have to modify one component and we don't have to modify another component that time we have to use or that time react use the key attribute now in here in our country list we're going to give key. And for this perfect match will be the country dot country code right because each country have different country code that's why I'm going to use country in here now you can see that we don't have we haven't got any error yeah also you can see in the components you have like for each country you have the key. And have such that the key can be used for the react. Thank you in this video we have run the component concepts in the next video we're going to just style our these components country list and country and it will look much better and it will be look like this yeah thanks. Thank you.

Hi guys, in this video we are going to start styling our components. But first of all we are going to get the emails and we are going to also describe our Corona virus cases. So I have an API, Country Flags API. In here you can get a source or the link. And it has used the BE, that's for the country code. That's why I have saved the country code in our project. So I'm just going to copy it and I'm going to link in our description for the link. Now in our project, in our project in here, I'm just going to, in Country.js, I'm just going to paste it in here. But as you know, this is a dynamic because we don't have a hard coded country code. So that's why we have to get dynamically. Now in here it will be string interpolation. Because in here I'm going to use dollar sign and use the props. And from props we have used states and we're going to use what? We're going to use Country code, yeah, right one. So I'm going to use the Country code in here. Now again it gives some error that's because like it doesn't write because we have to give Alt in here. And in here you can give the country name as alternate. Yeah, just give it the alternate. So I'm going to use props dot states dot country. Now if you just save it and go to our project. You can see that we got the flag now next to what now we have to give just change into s2. And what we have to do next we have to give a new day in which we have the description and what we want the what are the description that we want. So in here what we want we want active cases that guess okay. Now in here we're going to use p tag and use the dollars and the curly braces such that I'm going to inject some values from the props. Now again I'm going to use string interpolation and use like this active and use colon and just write dollar sign and use what props dot states. Yeah, that's what this. So I'm just going to copy it and just after that we're going to just change it wherever it's needed. Well, all places it's needed. That's why now in here what we know we want recovered. So just going to give recovered and here we're going to give recovered and in here we're going to give debts. In here we're going to give again that's now in here we're going to give confirmed. Well, I have to write some card code with it now just give in here now that's it. Yeah, that's what we want. Yeah, we got the all the things right now next thing we're going to do we're going to just styling our project. Now in our app.js here I have app so I'm just going to remove this whole bunch of glasses that we don't need. Now in here I'm just going to use I'm just going to use this styling in here you can see that we have got worth of 95%. I have used display flags and all the elements will be in column and it will be all in center with respect to the 95% worth and all the element will be align center means to lead the center site. Now if you just save it you can see right now it's not look good. Now that's all in app.css is done in what we need in our country list we're going to first of all we're going to create one new file and its name will be country list.css. And in here in import we're going to import this css by using country list.css. And in here I'm just going to use glass name give the country list glass name I have given its name. I'm just going to copy it. Oh just man what have I'm just going to copy this text now in here just I'm going to copy paste css. So this is what I have copied this is the grid display and the template will be column in grid template column. This is one very helpful syntax you can say and I want I want to recommend that you have you to do this because this is what actual developer do. Now I have used a grid gap of one with Rm and worth is 100% such that it will take whole place of which 95% now if you just looking to here. That's something yeah it's good yeah it's responsive also you can see now again our more things to see now this is complete the country list is complete now. Other is what I'm going to do is in country. In country I'm going to create one new css file country dot css and in country dot j s in VS code if you are new you can use like this such that you can see also the code in here also see the css file. And this is the button is here for you to split the editor now in here I'm just going to import country dot css and I'm going to use class name in here say the name country. Then there is one more class that I'm going to use in here and that's call it is describe now I'm just going to save it and in here I'm just going to use dot country. There this is what I have copied just to say yeah this is what I have copied now these are all the css that we need for the project completion now you can see the wall that's not look good well we have the font well we are going to change the font in the later video for now you can see this is what. So this is what our project looks like so this half is done the next video we are going to create our own search box such that we can use this search box in any place in any project and yeah that's all thanks.
