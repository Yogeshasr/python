The video tutorial explains how to use functions in JavaScript. A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be reused throughout the code. The speaker demonstrates how to declare a function using the "function" keyword, followed by the function name and parameters (if any). They create two example functions: one that prints a message to an HTML element with a specific ID, and another that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum. The speaker shows how to call these functions and use their results to update HTML elements on a web page.

The text discusses the basics of functions in JavaScript. It explains how to declare a function using the "function" keyword, define parameters, and write code inside curly braces. The speaker demonstrates how to reuse a function by passing different parameters, such as adding different numbers or concatenating strings. They also cover key terms like "return", "calling a function", and "arguments". The goal is to show how functions make it easy to perform tasks repeatedly and reuse code.
