The speaker is building an app using React and starts by fetching country data from an API. They create a state with a "countries" property and use the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method to fetch the data. They then use the `fetch` API and `await` syntax to get the response and extract the country data. Next, they loop through each country and fetch the COVID-19 case data for that country using another API call. They use the `setState` method with a callback function to update the state with the fetched data, concatenating each country's data to an array. The speaker explains various JavaScript concepts, such as async/await syntax, lifecycle methods, and state management in React.

The text appears to be a transcript of a video tutorial on React development. The speaker discusses how to fetch data from an API, handle responses, and render country names using JSX. They also cover common issues such as handling empty arrays and undefined properties. The speaker uses `async/await` methods and explains how to use JavaScript syntax within JSX curly braces. The goal is to display a list of country names, and the speaker sets up the foundation for this in the current video, with plans to continue building on it in the next video.
