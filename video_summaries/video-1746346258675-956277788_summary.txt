The article discusses how to make React components reusable and dynamic using props (short for properties). Props allow you to pass data from a parent component to a child component, making it possible to display different information without having to create multiple versions of the same component. To use props, you specify them as attributes in the parent component and then access them in the child component using the `props` parameter. You can then use these props to render dynamic content within the component. The article provides examples of how to pass props, access them in the child component, and display the data using JSX expressions wrapped in curly braces. By understanding how to use props, you can create reusable components that can be customized with different data, making your React applications more flexible and efficient.

The text discusses how to use "props" (short for properties) in React components. Props allow developers to pass dynamic data from a parent component to a child component. There are two ways to pass props: as attributes or as children content between the opening and closing tags of the component. The props are then accessed using the `props` object in functional components or `this.props` in class components. However, props are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once they are set. Any attempt to modify a prop will result in an error. The text also explains that React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props parameter, and changing props is not allowed under any circumstance. The concept of maintaining component data that might change over time is left for discussion in the next video.
