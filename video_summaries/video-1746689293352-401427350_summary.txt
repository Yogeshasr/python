The speaker is creating a React component called "CountryList" and explaining the process step by step. They start by showing how to access the country code for each country using the spread operator in JavaScript. They then create a new folder called "components" and inside it, create a new file called "ControlList.js". In this file, they import React and define a functional component. They export the component so it can be imported into another file, specifically "App.js". The speaker also explains how to pass data from the parent component ("App.js") to the child component ("CountryList") using props. The video is part of a series and the speaker promises to explain more about state and props in later videos.

The speaker is creating a React application that displays a list of countries with their corresponding COVID-19 statistics. They create a `Country` component and import it into the main component, using props to pass data from one component to another. The speaker explains how to use keys in React to distinguish between multiple components with similar characteristics, which helps React determine which components to re-render when changes are made. In this case, they use the country code as a unique key for each country. The video covers basic concepts of React components and props, and sets the stage for styling the components in the next video.
