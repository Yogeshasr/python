The article discusses how components in React can be made reusable by using "props" (short for properties), which allows for dynamic input into a component. Props are optional inputs that a component can accept, and they enable the component to display different data without having to rewrite the code. To use props, you specify them as attributes on the component tag, and then access those values in the component function using the `props` parameter. The article provides an example of how to pass a name prop to a "Grid" component and display it in the browser, and also shows how to add multiple props (e.g. "name" and "heroName") to make the component even more reusable. Additionally, the article touches on how to render unknown content using props. Overall, the use of props makes components more flexible and reusable, allowing for greater efficiency and modularity in React applications.

The text discusses how to use "props" (short for properties) in React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. There are two ways to pass props: as attributes or as children (content between the opening and closing tags of a component). The text provides examples of how to use props with both functional and class components. It also explains that props are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once they are set. This is a strict rule in React, and attempting to change a prop will result in an error. The text concludes by mentioning that props are a fundamental feature in React and will be used in most applications, but raises the question of how to handle changing component data, which will be discussed in a future video.
