The speaker is creating a project that displays COVID-19 case information, including flags, active cases, recovered cases, deaths, and confirmed cases. They are using an API to fetch country codes and flags. The speaker is writing code in JavaScript and CSS to style the components, including creating a grid display for the country list. They are also using string interpolation to inject values from props into the HTML. The goal is to create a visually appealing and organized display of COVID-19 case information by country.

The speaker is working on a project, specifically on a "country" section. They created a new CSS file called "country.css" and imported it into their JavaScript file. They applied two classes, "country" and "describe", to style the content. The speaker showed the updated project and mentioned that they will change the font in a later video. They also announced that the next video will focus on creating a custom search box that can be used in any project.
