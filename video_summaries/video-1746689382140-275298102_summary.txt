The creator is starting to build a new web app called "RoboFriends" in their video.

The text describes setting up a React application using `create-react-app` to build a RoboFriends project. The author explains the process of installing the app, exploring the project structure, and understanding the dependencies, scripts, and components. They cover topics such as:

* Installing `create-react-app` using `npx`
* Understanding the project structure, including the `src` folder, `App.js`, and `index.js` files
* Exploring the dependencies, including `react` and `react-dom`
* Running the app using `npm start`
* Building and testing the app
* Understanding how React components work, including functional and class components

The author also explains how the different parts of the project are linked together, including the `index.html` file in the `public` folder and the `App.js` component. The goal is to build a simple React project, RoboFriends, which displays a list of robots with their names and emails, and allows filtering by name.
