The text appears to be a jumbled and repetitive expression of affection, with the speaker declaring their love and desire to be with someone, using phrases such as "you are my sunshine" and "I love you". The language is simple and emotive, but also somewhat incoherent and fragmented. It's possible that this is a poem or song lyrics, rather than a piece of standard prose.
